      <description>We want to include a less technical description of how the project is structured for people that are interested, but are less familiar with code. It will also help us work on making the project more understandable and improve our ability to explain it to others.
The app you are using is written in Kotlin, and the backend that supports it is in Rust. We had some previous experience with Android development, but are completely new to Rust.</description>

      <description>Why we don&amp;rsquo;t use identity providers Identity providers (eg. login with Google, Facebook&amp;hellip;) often lack open-source practices, making it difficult to trust their security, but mostly privacy measures. We&amp;rsquo;re not comfortable relying solely on size and reputation of a company when it comes to sensitive user data. Also, using identity providers centralizes logins, ending up with all you accounts under you Google/Apple/Facebook/Amazon.
Secure Password Management We use and recommend KeePassDX for Android and KeePassXC for Desktop.</description>

      <description>Free and Open source Other people explain this way better than we ever could, you can read about it here
GNU Philosophy Free Software You can find open source alternatives to your favorito apps and tools here
We try to use as many open source technologies as we can, but have made some compromises out of necessity, we&amp;rsquo;re still learning the ropes with lesser-known open-source options. Our goal is to fully embrace open technologies as our expertise grows.</description>
