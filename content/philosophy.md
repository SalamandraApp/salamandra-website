Other people explain this way better than we ever could, you can read about it here
 - [GNU Philosophy](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html)
 - [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
 - [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/about)
 - [What is Free Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)

You can find open source alternatives to your favorito apps and tools [here](https://www.opensourcealternative.to/)
