### Free and Open source

Compared to probably most of the apps you use Salamandra is open-source, meaning the code is on the Internet for everyone to see. We believe this is really important, but other people explain this way better than we ever could, you can read about it here

 - [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)

If you are curious, you can find open source alternatives to your favorite apps and tools [here](https://www.opensourcealternative.to/)

We try to use as many open source technologies as we can, but have made some compromises out of necessity, we're still learning the ropes with lesser-known open-source options. Our goal is to fully embrace open technologies as our expertise grows.
